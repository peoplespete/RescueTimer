Feature Idea for RescueTime's Productivity Service

As I've thought about RescueTime's incredible amount of browsing data, I wonder, am I often a little distracted or rarely very distracted?  And does the distraction pattern follow a pattern by site or activity?

Assuming it does, I've mocked out a feature in which a user can categorize sites as a glancer (a site that is best used briefly in moments of boredom) or an engrosser (a site that is best used for extended periods to be beneficial).  This categorization could then be tied to a time management feature, which could limit access to these sites or activities.

The rules are as follows:
- A user starts with a 50 minute allowance of time to use on glancers and engrossers
- Start using a glancer and each minute (I sped up the minutes so it wouldn't get boring) counts as 1 minute until you reach the 5th minute.  Then each minute charges you 5 minutes.  By classifying the site as a glancer, you incentivise only glancing at the site.
- Start using an engrosser and each of the first 5 minutes counts as 5 minutes apiece since you shouldn't be using an engrosser for a short period.  Once you cross into the 6th minute each minute only counts as one minute and you have the first 5 overcharged minutes returned to you.
